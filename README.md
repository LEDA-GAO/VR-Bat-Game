# VR Bat Game

VR Bat Game is a interactable VR Game created by using Unity. In this game, you will be flying as a bat in a beautiful twilight scenery and you can use the grab feature of the controller to catch mosquitoes. 

## Installation 

To install the game to your VR set, you first need to download the file. 

```
FINAL bat game build.apk 
```

If your VR set is Oculus Quest, you can download SideQuest to install the apk package. The tutorial for SideQuest is easy to find online. 

To look and modify this game's original code, you can use Unity to open the whole folder as a project.  

## Contribution

I contributed to this project as a volunteer and collaberated with a group in the University of Texas at Austin(Amanda, Fanyi, Ishita, Nimra, Soojin). 
I mainly designed and created the mosquito animation, interaction feature(grab the mosquitoes and destroy it afterwards), and the sound effect of grabing and mosquitoes.
